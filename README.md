# Rapid-Roll-Game-Using-C-Graphics
Rapid Roll : Roll the ball is a kind of fall down game with a lot of fun and challenges. Your mission is to move the ball between the platforms without crashing into neither the top, the bottom nor the spikes. This game is developed in C language. As you go, you must continue to run in each platform inorder to score a point. Staying too long on a platform also causes you to lose the game because lingering causes the platform to push you up into spikes that lie in the top.

Use Turbo C++ to run NROLL.C file.
